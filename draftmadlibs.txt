There once was a COLOR NOUN sitting in PLACE.  When PERSON went to pick it up, it burst into flames in a totally ADJ way.  PERSON was very ADJ2 after this experience, so they went to PLACE2 and PLACE3 and PLACE4.  The PLACE2 was ADJ3 and they had to VERB a NOUN2.

One day when he was out walking, he came to an ADJ3 PLACE2 in the middle of PLACE, and in the middle of this place was a ADJ2 COLOR NOUN2, and, from the top of the NOUN2, there came a ADJ NOUN.  PERSON sat down at (PLACE3 | the foot of NOUN2), put his head (in PLACE4 | between his paws) and began to VERB.
